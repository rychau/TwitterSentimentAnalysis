Could not get this done in windows. I just installed Ubuntu 10.4 via Windows Store to use on my Windows 10 desktop.

You need to install Python3+ (Used Python 3.5) 
You need to install PiP (to install python-twitter)
Use pip to install python-twitter ("pip install python-twitter")

!!!I had trouble with pip picking python2.7 by default. So I Used:
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
To install pip directly to my python3 install.
Then,
pip3 install python-twitter

Compile using Ubuntu Terminal(navigate to directory, all files in same spot)
g++ -o tweetrate -I /usr/include/python3 main.cpp -lpython3.5m

Run using Ubuntu Terminal:
./tweetrate
